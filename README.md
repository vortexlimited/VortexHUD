Modern Circular HUD for QBCore Framework

Overview

VX HUD is a modern and minimalist circular HUD designed for the QBCore framework in FiveM.
It provides a clean user interface focused on vehicle information, player status, and voice activity, inspired by contemporary HUD designs used in modern games.

The HUD is highly customizable and optimized for roleplay servers, with per-player saved settings and smooth visual feedback.
